# 3mpiler (WIP)
a toy compiler for a very simple and in early phase toy language called 3Script

## How does it work?

The program takes a .h3s file that contains the 3Script code (Rules of the language will be further explained) and compiles it into x86_64 NASM code and then assembles it.


# RULES OF THE LANGUAGE

### types
- int, string, char


### Declare a variable
``` <typename> [NAME] = <value>; ```

### Print
``` print <value>; ```

Right now you can declare variables and print simple strings.


# PLANS FOR THE PROJECT

- Be able to print variables
- if statements
- loops
